# Employee Management System

<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project

Employee management system designed to enable users to manage employee information and hiring contracts in a convenient and efficient manner using Java programming language. The system has various features such as adding a new employee, starting a hiring contract for registered employees, ending an employee's hiring contract, displaying employee information, and displaying the HRS system status. The system has a validation system in place that ensures that users enter valid inputs. This means that any data entered by the user will be validated and checked for correctness before it is stored in the system. This helps to maintain data accuracy and reduce errors.
